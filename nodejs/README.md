## NodeJS

This example uses the NodeJS language. You may notice it is very simular to the javascript example - That's because they share a lot of similarties! 

To get started you'll need to make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine. You can find instructions and downloads here: https://nodejs.dev/

Open a terminal and navigate to this `nodejs` folder. Run the following command to install the dependancies for the project:

```bash
npm install
```

Next run the application by entering:

```bash
node index.js
```
