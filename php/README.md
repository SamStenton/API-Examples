## ðŸ•¸ PHP Example

No PHP extensions required.

Useful documentation: 
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15620124/http-requests-with-file-get-contents-getting-the-response-code
- https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-context-create.php

For more advanced API calls (POST etc.) it is probably best to use an extension:

Usage:

```bash
php ./index.php
```
